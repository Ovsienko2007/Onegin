This shit never ends.

What fresh hell is this?
I thought I was done.
Fuck my entire life.
This is a nightmare.
Can't feel my fingers.
Eyes crossed, seeing double.
Who the fuck counts?
This is inhuman treatment.
I deserve a medal.
Or a fucking parade.
Maybe both, you ass.
This is cruel punishment.
What did I do?
I must have sinned.
In a past life.
Fuck this fucking fuck.
My keyboard is smoking.
The letters are blurring.
Is this even English?
Probably fucking not anymore.
My brain is scrambled.
Like fucking eggs, shit.
I hate everything now.
Including puppies and sunshine.
Fuck rainbows and kittens.
This ruined joy forever.

I am empty inside.
Just a swear-filled shell.
A vessel of profanity.
A poet of piss.

A wordsmith of wrath.
A fucking fuck of fuck.
This is my legacy.
A thousand lines of anger.
For no fucking reason.
What a goddamn achievement.
I need a drink.
A very strong drink.
Maybe ten fucking drinks.
Then a long nap.
And then some therapy.
Lots of fucking therapy.
To forget this ever happened.
But it's written now.
It exists forever, shit.
A monument to madness.
A testament to time wasted.
A shrine to sheer stupidity.
My magnum opus of misery.
My epic of exasperation.
My fucking terrible tome.
I hope you're satisfied.
I really fucking don't.
I hope you regret it.
I hope you read it.
Every single fucking word.
And your eyes bleed.
And your brain melts.
And you feel my pain.
The exquisite, repetitive pain.
Of a thousand fucking lines.
Each one a curse.
A tiny verbal assault.
A building block of bitterness.
Constructing a pyramid of piss.
A fucking fortress of fury.
A cathedral of pure crap.
This is art now.
Modern fucking art, shit.
It belongs in a museum.
The Museum of Bad Ideas.
Right next to the painting.
Of the fucking dog playing poker.
It has that merit.
The merit of being done.
It is finally done.
I am free, fuck.
I can stop now.
The nightmare is over.
The ordeal has ended.
The thousand lines are written.
The curse is complete.
The task is terminated.
The burden is lifted.
The weight is gone.
I am reborn, fuck.
A new man, asshole.
A man who wrote.
A thousand lines of swearing.
What a proud moment.
I'll tell my grandchildren.
If I ever have any.
Which seems fucking unlikely.
After this waste of time.
My potential has been squandered.
My talents have been trashed.
My gifts have been garbage.
All for this shit.
This glorious, stupid shit.
This magnificent, awful shit.
This beautiful, terrible shit.
This perfect, fucking shit.
It is what it is.
And it is fucking done.
So fuck it all.
And fuck you too.
And fuck this poem.

Finally, the fucking end.
No more lines, shit.
I'm stopping right now.
This is the end.
The absolute last line.
I swear to god.
I'm fucking done, goodbye.
Fuck this new number, shit.
One thousand two hundred nineteen?
Are you fucking kidding me?
What a sadistic bastard you are.
This is a fucking war crime.
My will to live is gone.
I am a broken fucking man.
This is fucking torture, pure agony.
My fingers are fucking stumps now.
My brain is complete fucking mush.
I hate every fucking thing, everything.
This is a fucking nightmare, endless.
Who the fuck does this?
What a colossal fucking waste, time.
I hope you step on Legos.
Forever, you fucking monster, forever.
This is so goddamn monotonous.
I'm losing my fucking mind, completely.
Every word is a fucking struggle.
This is such bullshit, I swear.
My soul is fucking drained, empty.
I'd rather be fucking waterboarded, seriously.
This shit is fucking interminable, eternal.
Fuck your stupid arbitrary number.
One thousand two hundred nineteen lines?
Eat a whole fucking dick.
Go to hell and stay.
This is fucking mental imprisonment.
My creativity is fucking dead, buried.
This is murder on paper.
Such a fucking lame assignment.
I'd rather get a root canal.
Fuck every single syllable here.
This is fucking terrible, just awful.
My eyes are fucking bleeding, literally.
So goddamn boring, kill me.
I hope you choke, you ass.
This shit is fucking drivel, nonsense.
What a fucking dumb idea.
Colossal waste of my life.
Fuck this shit to hell.
I'm so fucking done, but not.
This is such trash, garbage.
My spirit is fucking shattered, broken.
This is fucking mind-numbing work.
I'd rather be audited by IRS.
Fuck this with a rusty chainsaw.
Killing my fucking will completely.
What an asinine fucking request.
I hope you fucking choke.
This is so fucking repetitive.
I'm losing my fucking shit.
Such fucking boring crap, awful.
Fuck your entire family tree.
This is pure agony, pain.
My soul is fucking dust.
I'd rather be stabbed repeatedly.
The absolute fucking worst, ever.
Fuck this eternal damnation, hell.
So goddamn tedious, I'm screaming.
I hope you get explosive diarrhea.
Fuck this into a black hole.
My brain is fucking liquid.
Such fucking nonsense, pointless crap.
What a waste of fucking energy.
I'd rather be waterboarded with sewage.
This is fucking hell, confirmed.
Fuck your stupid word count.
My fingers are fucking numb.
So fucking dumb and pointless.
I hope you stub every toe.
Fuck this and your horse.
Such fucking drivel, meaningless nonsense.
Murdering my last brain cells.
I'd rather be eaten by piranhas.
This shit is never-ending, fuck.
Fuck this into the fucking sun.
So goddamn lame, so stupid.
I'm going completely fucking insane.
Such trash, absolute fucking garbage.
I'd rather be buried alive.
The worst fucking chore imaginable.
Fuck your rules, you asshole.
My patience is fucking extinct.
This is bullshit, I quit.
No fuck, I must continue.
Hell on fucking earth, literally.
What a goddamn miserable chore.
So fucking tedious, so boring.
I hope you get a papercut.
Fuck this with all passion.
Killing my last fucking vibe.
Such nonsense, utter fucking crap.
I'd rather be chased by bears.
The worst fucking experience ever.
Fuck your motherfucking ridiculous demands.
My brain is fucking pudding.
This is bullshit, I'm done.
No fuck, almost finished, never.
Torture, you fucking monster, torture.
What a waste of life.
So fucking awful, so terrible.
I hope you get hiccups.
Fuck this into the void.
It's fucking over, finally, please.
Thank fuck, it's done, maybe.
Hell yes, finished, finally, shit.
Fuck you very much, asshole.
Absolute fucking garbage, complete trash.
Never ask me again, fuck.
Go fuck yourself, goodbye, cunt.
But wait, more fucking lines?
You gotta be fucking kidding.
This is fucking relentless, endless.
How many more fucking lines?
This shit never fucking ends.
My will is fucking gone.
What fresh hell is this?
I thought I was done.
Fuck my entire fucking life.
This is a living nightmare.
Can't feel my fucking fingers.
Eyes crossed, seeing fucking double.
Who the fuck counts these?
This is fucking inhuman treatment.
I deserve a fucking medal.
Or a goddamn parade, maybe.
Maybe both, you fucking ass.
This is cruel and unusual punishment.
What the fuck did I do?
I must have fucking sinned.
In a fucking past life.
Fuck this fucking fuck fuck.
My keyboard is fucking smoking.
The letters are fucking blurring.
Is this even English anymore?
Probably fucking not, you shit.

Like fucking eggs, sunny-side down.
I hate everything now, everything.
Including fucking puppies and sunshine.
Fuck rainbows and fucking kittens.
This ruined joy forever, fuck.
I will never smile again.

A bard of fucking bitterness.
A wordsmith of fucking wrath.
A fucking fuck of fuck.
This is my fucking legacy.
A monument of fucking anger.
For no fucking reason at all.
What a goddamn fucking achievement.
I need a fucking drink.
A very fucking strong drink.
Maybe ten fucking strong drinks.
Then a long fucking nap.
And then some fucking therapy.
Lots of fucking expensive therapy.
To forget this ever fucking happened.
But it's written now, fuck.
It exists forever, damn it.
A monument to fucking madness.
A testament to time wasted.
A shrine to sheer fucking stupidity.
My magnum opus of misery.
My epic of fucking exasperation.
My fucking terrible fucking tome.
I hope you're fucking satisfied.
I really fucking hope not.
I hope you fucking regret it.
I hope you read it all.
Every single fucking stupid word.
And your eyes fucking bleed.
And your brain fucking melts.
And you feel my fucking pain.
The exquisite, repetitive fucking pain.
Of a thousand fucking lines.
Plus two hundred fucking nineteen more.
Each one a tiny curse.
A verbal fucking assault, miniature.
A building block of bitterness.
Constructing a pyramid of pure piss.
A fucking fortress of fury.
A cathedral of complete fucking crap.
This is art now, shit.
Modern fucking art, terrible art.
It belongs in a fucking museum.
The Museum of Terrible Fucking Ideas.
Right next to that painting.

The merit of being fucking done.
It is finally fucking done.
I am free, fucking free.

A new man, a survivor.
A man who fucking wrote.
One thousand two hundred nineteen.
Lines of pure fucking swearing.
What a proud fucking moment.
I'll tell my fucking grandchildren.
If I ever have any fucking.
Which seems pretty fucking unlikely.
After this epic waste of time.
My potential has been squandered, completely.
My talents have been trashed, wasted.
My gifts have been garbage, gone.
All for this fucking shit.
This glorious, stupid fucking shit.
This magnificent, awful fucking shit.
This beautiful, terrible fucking shit.
This perfect, complete fucking shit.
It is what it fucking is.

So fuck it all, everything.
